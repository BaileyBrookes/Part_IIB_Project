### Developing a cheap module using GPS and pressure sensor to measure accurately take-off distance required (TODR)
This is the enire project directory, files/folders of note are:

1. AircraftDataLogger - KiCad design files for PCB design

2. \Code\Arduino Sketches\Firmware - Firmware for the PCB

3. Code\TODR.py - Python script that calculates TODR and ground roll

4. Code\CheapDGPS2.py - Script investigating the DGPS idea, with data collected in preliminary testing

Other python scripts have been used in investigation and making plots.
